//Templates is one of the most important concepts in C++. If you learn and apply it well it will give you the edge 
 over other Competitive Programmers.

###Why do we need templates?
->as we know
  Class is a template for object i.e we can create multiple objects giving multiple meanings 
  and just like that 
  Template is a template for class ,what does it mean ?
-> It means that template gives the rights for creating a single Class which can give multiple meanings.

 let's take an example :
   class a{
   int *arr;       //In class a if we have to input array with float/char/long datatype we have to make multiple classes
   public:             which violates the DRY(Donot Repeat yourself)
   }
   So the main reason for using templates is:
   --> DRY
   -->For generic programming(not being specific)

## Syntax for templates
 --> template<class T>    //where T can be int/float/long/ or any datatype 
    class vector{
    T *arr;
    public:
    vector(T *r)
     {
       //code
      }
    };
      int main(){
     vector<int> obj1;
      vector<float> obj2;
